Last Wednesday I gave a small talk at a development clinic for my colleagues at [Zicht Online](http://zicht.nl). We regularly organise these clinics to share cool stuff with the people we work with. We eat semi-healthy food, we talk about technology, and we experiment with new languages, frameworks and development software.

I explained the thought process behind re-usable and scalable CSS, and I showed some techniques to achieve CSS that's not actually a maintenance nightmare. There's also a bit about PostCSS as well.
