        <p>I&rsquo;ve been creating for a reasonable number of years. Those years creating were spent creating for others. I had countless ideas of myself, but I always came up with excuses. The guilt of those excuses built up over time, when, finally, I&rsquo;d had it. Enough was enough.<br>
You&rsquo;re looking at the result: a new website, just for me. A wanky piece of self-indulgence, but it&rsquo;s mine.</p>

<h3>Where I pretend it was a struggle</h3>

<p>When you&rsquo;re planning to tell the internet about yourself, you have to figure out who you are.</p>

<ul>
<li>Am I a web developer who knows about typography and layouts?</li>
<li>Am I a designer who knows about code?</li>
<li>Am I a programmer who knows about the web?</li>
</ul>

<p>I still don&rsquo;t know, and I don&rsquo;t want to choose. I&rsquo;m all of the above and I like it.<br>
When trying to start building my personal website, it posed a bit of a problem though: I wanted to do everything myself, in the best way possible, lest I perceive myself an unworthy designer and developer. This lead to endless stalling. &ldquo;I need to design a blog. But then I need somewhere to write posts. I guess I need some sort of admin interface. My situation is very unique, so I have to build it myself.&rdquo; </p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ve started over at least five times.</p>

<p>Then, I decided to let go. Make a design and let other software publish the site. Not writing all the code for my own website seemed like a scary premise, but peace of mind and an actual result loomed at the end of this life-draining ordeal.</p>

<p>Finally, I did it. Thanks for visiting.</p>

<h3>Now what?</h3>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m adding examples of past work as I go, and I&rsquo;m starting up the habit of writing posts.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m working on a football website called <a href="http://clubwatcher.nl">Clubwatcher</a>. (Go to <a href="http://feyenoord.clubwatcher.nl">our Feyenoord page</a> if you&rsquo;re a supporter of Feyenoord.)</li>
<li>I have several poster projects lined up, ready for print.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m availabe for hire, if you need something designed or programmed.</li>
</ul>
