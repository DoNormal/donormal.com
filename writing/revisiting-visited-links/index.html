        <p>It&rsquo;s easier to decide where you want to go if you know where you&rsquo;ve been.</p>

<p>Sounds like the start of some awful seminar on how to improve your life. It isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a principle of digital design that seems to have been forgotten. This is a reminder to designers out there.</p>

<hr>

<p>By default, browsers show links to already visited pages in a different colour. They&rsquo;re purple. They actually feel used. A great feature, because people scan pages for things they want to read, skipping what they don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s one of those details that can unconsciously delight your users.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s a detail that gets thrown away by a lot of designers. One colour for all links seems to be enough, but it&rsquo;s not. Let me show you why.</p>

<h3>On Medium</h3>

<p><a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a> is one of the best designed sites out there. The design is deceivingly simple, but every pixel is considered. However, they do not show visited articles in a different colour, and I think they should.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a side-by-side comparison of their current design and a mockup I made.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/visited-links.png" alt="Medium.com without and with styling of visited links"> </p>

<p>On the left, I can&rsquo;t tell which article I&rsquo;ve opened. On the right, I can clearly see I&rsquo;ve read the second and third article. When I look for articles I want to read next, the right image makes more sense.</p>

<h3>On TheNextWeb</h3>

<p>Sites that use images as links can apply the same principle. Let&rsquo;s take a look at <a href="http://thenextweb.com/">TheNextWeb</a>, a news site about technology.</p>

<p>First, the site as they designed it. They do not distinguish visited links from other links.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/visited-links-tnw-01.png" alt="visited-links-tnw-01"> </p>

<p>Again, this page can benefit from the visited links principle. A quick mockup results in something like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/visited-links-tnw-02.png" alt="visited-links-tnw-02"> </p>

<p>A clear improvement, I believe.</p>

<p>Note: I use these two sites as an example because they were just the first ones that came to mind. I don&rsquo;t know what their considerations for not using this feature were; perhaps they had good reasons.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a designer and in charge of a website, consider adding this important detail. It takes just a few minutes and a few lines of CSS to implement. Be the start of a better web.</p>
